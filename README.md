# What is this?
This is an endless console lift

# What is special about it?
* Randomly generated floors and peoples
* When the elevator picks up people, he finds the maximum floor (or the minimum, depending on the majority) and picks up or get out people down the road to the planned floor.
* When new people come to the lift he calculate new max or min floor one more time.
* When people get out from lift they get new target floor so lift never stops.
* When the elevator does not find new people on the floor and he is empty, he finds the nearest floor with people and goes there
* Drawing all the lift actions
* It's uning Java
* It's my example of coding java
* It is beautiful
